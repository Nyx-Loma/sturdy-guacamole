# Phase 0 – Baseline Plan for `@sanctum/storage`

## Context
- Package currently consists of placeholder README only; no source modules present in `packages/storage/src`.
- Desired outcome: production-ready storage abstraction covering relational, blob, and queue/stream backends with strong encryption guarantees.
- Key stakeholders: Storage platform team, security engineering, SRE, consuming feature squads (messaging, media, backup), DX tooling group.

## Objectives
- Establish authoritative scope for Phase 0 to unblock design & implementation phases.
- Capture high-level requirements, constraints, and success metrics.
- Produce initial backlog of decisions, research tasks, and documentation deliverables.

## Success Criteria
- Consensus on supported environments (Node LTS versions, minimum TS target, serverless considerations).
- Documented domain model primitives (object, bucket/namespace, version, metadata, ACL).
- MVP workload assumptions defined (throughput, object size distribution, multi-tenancy expectations).
- Integration map of dependent services with data residency, compliance, and security requirements.
- Draft testing strategy aligned with “super strong testing” mandate (see companion testing doc).
- Approved architectural decision records (ADRs) list to produce in Phase 1.

## Non-Goals
- Implementing storage adapters or runtime code.
- Finalizing encryption primitive choices beyond ensuring existing `@sanctum/crypto` coverage.
- Performance benchmarking; deferred until Phase 2 prototypes.

## Workstreams & Owners
- Requirements gathering: product + consuming squads.
- Threat modeling & compliance: security engineering.
- Infrastructure capabilities survey: SRE + infra platform.
- Developer experience & API ergonomics: storage platform team.

## Deliverables
- `docs/requirements.md`: compiled functional + non-functional requirements.
- `docs/environment-matrix.md`: runtime/platform support matrix.
- `docs/domain-model.md`: entity definitions, lifecycle diagrams, naming conventions.
- `docs/adr/000-base-architecture.md`: placeholder ADR ready for Phase 1 completion.
- `docs/testing-strategy.md`: detailed testing plan (drafted in parallel).
- Backlog tickets in Jira/Linear covering research spikes and ADR drafting.

## Research Backlog (initial)
- Evaluate target data stores (Postgres, DynamoDB, Redis Streams, S3/GCS) for availability in our infra.
- Audit existing encryption envelope patterns in messaging service for reuse.
- Identify regulatory obligations (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA) influencing storage design.
- Survey observability pipelines and logging retention constraints.
- Benchmark serialization formats (JSON, protobuf, avro) for compatibility with consumers.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Scope creep**: Maintain change-control via ADR process; capture stretch goals separately.
- **Compliance blockers**: Engage legal/compliance during requirements gathering; flag gating items.
- **Testing debt**: Embed testing requirements in user stories; treat missing tests as acceptance failure.
- **Resource contention**: Secure cross-team commitments early; add schedule buffer for security reviews.

## Timeline (est.)
- Week 1: Requirements interviews, environment matrix draft.
- Week 2: Domain modeling workshops, threat modeling session.
- Week 3: Consolidate findings, finalize docs, review with stakeholders.

## Approvals Needed
- Storage platform lead sign-off on scope.
- Security engineering approval on compliance coverage.
- Infra/SRE confirmation on environment matrix.
- Product leadership agreement on Phase 1 entrance criteria.
