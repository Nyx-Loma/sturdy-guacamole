# Phase 2 – Implementation & Production Readiness

## Goals
1. Ship production-ready adapters (Postgres record store, S3/MinIO blob store, Redis/Kafka stream store) with full contract coverage and defined SLOs.
2. Harden caching, consistency, and observability so the facade meets performance and reliability targets.
3. Ensure security/compliance (envelope encryption, ACL enforcement, redaction in audit logs).
4. Build load/chaos testing pipeline and expanded golden test coverage.
5. Deliver developer experience artifacts (sample apps/CLI, docs, runbooks) to support early adopters.

## Exit Criteria
- All three first-party adapters implemented, contract-tested, and passing on CI.
- ≥95% per-file coverage for `packages/storage/src/adapters/**`.
- Extended golden test suite (checksum mismatch, pagination stability, stream restart/backpressure, cache TTL expiry, retry policy) green.
- Nightly load + chaos runs pass for 7 consecutive days with SLOs met.
- Audit logs redact sensitive identifiers and include required metadata.
- Runbooks, migration scripts, and sample apps published; developer preview consumers onboarded.
- Phase 1 contract tests remain green on every PR (non-regression gate).

## Dependencies & Parallelization
- Postgres adapter and S3 adapter can proceed in parallel once schema contracts are agreed; Redis/Kafka adapter depends on cache invalidation design.
- Cache invalidation fan-out requires Redis adapter baseline; circuit breaker work depends on adapter instrumentation hooks.
- Envelope encryption can begin alongside adapters; audit log redaction ties into observability logging work.
- Integration/load/chaos testing blocked until at least one adapter (Postgres + S3) is functional with real infra.

## Workstreams & Tasks

### 1. Production Adapters
- [ ] Postgres record adapter (CRUD, optimistic locking, schema migrations).
- [ ] S3/MinIO blob adapter (multipart uploads, checksum verification, ACL integration).
- [ ] Redis/Kafka stream adapter (at-least-once delivery, cursor durability, backpressure).
- [ ] Shared adapter validation harness with dynamic fixtures.

### 2. Caching & Consistency Enhancements
- [ ] Implement Redis/in-memory cache providers with invalidation fan-out.
- [ ] Enforce `stalenessBudgetMs` using timestamps; add checksum probes for strong reads.
- [ ] Circuit breaker + retry policy integration (metrics + logs).

### 3. Security & Compliance
- [ ] Envelope encryption via `@sanctum/crypto`; adapters operate on ciphertext only.
- [ ] ACL enforcement hooks + audit logging (`acl.denied`, `object.deleted`).
- [ ] Audit log redaction rules; add tests ensuring sensitive fields are scrubbed.
- [ ] Compliance review (GDPR delete workflow, data residency notes).

### 4. Testing & Resilience
- [ ] Expanded golden tests (checksum mismatch, pagination stability, stream restart/backpressure, cache TTL expiry, retry backoff).
- [ ] Integration tests against real services (Docker Compose in CI).
- [ ] Load testing with k6; chaos testing via toxiproxy (nightly schedule + dashboards).
- [ ] Mutation testing on critical modules (Stryker).

### 5. Observability & Ops
- [ ] Plug metrics into shared exporter; feed dashboards (requests, latency, errors, cache hits, circuit-breaker state).
- [ ] Trace integration (OTel spans with storage attributes).
- [ ] Alerting + SLO definitions (latency, error rate, consistency violations).
- [ ] Operational tooling: migrations, health probes, chaos toggles.

### 6. DX & Documentation
- [ ] Adapter authoring guide and configuration reference.
- [ ] Sample CLI / minimal app demonstrating multi-adapter usage.
- [ ] Runbooks (deploy, rollback, incident response).
- [ ] Developer preview onboarding checklist for early consumers.

## Timeline (High-Level)
- Sprint 1–2: Postgres + S3 adapters; groundwork for Redis/Kafka adapter; basic caching.
- Sprint 3: Security/compliance features; observability exporter integration.
- Sprint 4: Expanded testing (golden/integration/load/chaos).
- Sprint 5: DX/docs, runbooks, sample apps, developer preview onboarding.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Adapter complexity**: dedicate adapter-specific spikes; reuse validation harness and contract tests.
- **Performance regressions**: integrate profiling + load tests early; define SLOs; automate regression alerts.
- **Security drift**: regular reviews with security team; automated audit log redaction tests.
- **Operational readiness**: pair with SRE for runbooks/dashboards; tabletop exercises before preview launch.

## Non-Regressions
- Phase 1 contract suite (`pnpm test:contracts`) must pass on every PR.
- Per-file coverage gates remain enforced (errors, observability, adapters).
