# 📊 Sanctum Platform - Full Repository Audit

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Repository:** https://github.com/Nyx-Loma/sturdy-guacamole  
**Overall Status:** B+ (Good) — 55% Production Ready  
**Current Coverage:** 92.19%  
**Test Suite:** 680 tests (662 passed, 18 skipped)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The Sanctum Platform is a **monorepo-based end-to-end encrypted messaging platform** with 6 services and 4 shared packages. The foundation is strong with world-class cryptography and excellent test coverage, but only **2 of 6 services are production-ready**. The platform is currently in **active development** with CI/CD now stabilized.

### Key Findings

✅ **Strengths:**
- 92.19% test coverage across entire codebase
- Production-ready Auth (8.0/10) and Directory (8.5/10) services
- World-class crypto package (9.0/10) with Double Ratchet implementation
- Robust transport layer (8.5/10) with WebSocket support
- Comprehensive testing: unit, integration, property-based, chaos, and load tests
- Well-documented with RUNBOOK, GA_READINESS, and PRODUCTION_ROADMAP

🔴 **Blockers:**
- 4 of 6 services are scaffolds (Messaging, Media, Backup, Admin)
- Integration tests require manual database setup (now improved with health checks)
- No OpenAPI documentation published for any service
- Feature flags not implemented (required by runbook)
- Secrets management immature (in-memory KMS only)
- No distributed rate limiting (Directory uses in-process only)
